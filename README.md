# Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge

Welcome to the **Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge** repository! This project represents the work of the **Data Phandas** team as we tackle this exciting and impactful competition hosted on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/outsmarting-outbreaks-challenge).

## About the Challenge

The Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge is focused on leveraging data science to predict and manage outbreaks effectively. By analyzing the provided datasets, participants aim to create models that can help in outbreak prediction, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making.

## Approach

Our approach to the challenge includes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding the dataset, identifying trends, and spotting anomalies.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and normalizing data to prepare it for modeling.
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature engineering.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Experimenting with multiple machine learning algorithms, including ensemble methods and deep learning techniques.
   - Tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error  to assess model accuracy and reliability.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Packaging the final solution for easy submission and potential real-world applications.

## Results

Our best-performing model achieved:

- **MAE:** 3.4
